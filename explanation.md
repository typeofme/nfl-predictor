- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced performance metrics creation
- **Prediction Models**: Multiple prediction methodologies
- **Visualization**: Statistical analysis and performance charts

---

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

### Data Structure Analysis Function
```python
def preprocess_csv_data(df):
    """Preprocess the CSV data for analysis"""
```

**Purpose**: Cleans and standardizes NFL team data from CSV format.

**Key Operations**:
1. **Type Conversion**: Converts string columns to numeric
   ```python
   numeric_columns = ['wins', 'losses', 'ties', 'winPct', 'pointsFor', 'pointsAgainst', 'netPoints']
   for col in numeric_columns:
       df_clean[col] = pd.to_numeric(df_clean[col], errors='coerce')
   ```

2. **Calculated Metrics**:
   - **Total Games**: `total_games = wins + losses + ties`
   - **Win Percentage**: `calculated_win_pct = wins / total_games`

3. **Record Parsing**: Extracts home/away performance from record strings
   - Format: "7 - 1 - 0" → homeWins=7, homeLosses=1, homeTies=0

**Mathematical Formula for Win Percentage**:
```
Win Percentage = Number of Wins / Total Games Played
Where: Total Games = Wins + Losses + Ties
```

## Mathematical Foundations

### Manual Correlation Coefficient

The notebook implements the Pearson correlation coefficient manually:

```python
def manual_correlation(x, y):
    """Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient manually"""
```

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
r = Σ((xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)) / √(Σ(xi - x̄)² × Σ(yi - ȳ)²)
```

Where:
- `r` = Pearson correlation coefficient (-1 ≤ r ≤ 1)
- `xi, yi` = individual data points
- `x̄, ȳ` = means of x and y respectively
- `Σ` = summation operator

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Calculate Means**:
   ```python
   x_mean = sum(x) / n
   y_mean = sum(y) / n
   ```

2. **Calculate Numerator**:
   ```python
   numerator = sum((x[i] - x_mean) * (y[i] - y_mean) for i in range(n))
   ```

3. **Calculate Denominators**:
   ```python
   x_variance = sum((x[i] - x_mean) ** 2 for i in range(n))
   y_variance = sum((y[i] - y_mean) ** 2 for i in range(n))
   ```

4. **Final Correlation**:
   ```python
   correlation = numerator / (x_variance * y_variance) ** 0.5
   ```

### Correlation Matrix Calculation

```python
def calculate_correlation_matrix(df, features):
    """Calculate correlation matrix manually"""
```

**Purpose**: Creates an n×n correlation matrix where each element [i,j] represents the correlation between feature i and feature j.

**Matrix Properties**:
- **Diagonal Elements**: Always equal to 1.0 (perfect self-correlation)
- **Symmetry**: Matrix is symmetric (correlation[i,j] = correlation[j,i])
- **Range**: All values between -1 and +1

## Linear Regression Implementation

### Manual Linear Regression Class

```python
class ManualLinearRegression:
    """Manual implementation of linear regression using normal equation"""
```

**Mathematical Foundation**: Uses the Normal Equation method to solve for optimal coefficients.

#### Normal Equation Formula:
```
θ = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T y
```

Where:
- `θ` = coefficient vector [intercept, coefficient1, coefficient2, ...]
- `X` = feature matrix with bias term
- `y` = target vector
- `X^T` = transpose of X
- `(X^T X)^(-1)` = inverse of X^T X

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Add Bias Term**:
   ```python
   X_with_bias = np.column_stack([np.ones(X.shape[0]), X])
   ```
   This adds a column of 1s for the intercept term.

2. **Calculate X^T X**:
   ```python
   XtX = np.dot(X_with_bias.T, X_with_bias)
   ```

3. **Calculate X^T y**:
   ```python
   Xty = np.dot(X_with_bias.T, y)
   ```

4. **Solve for Coefficients**:
   ```python
   theta = np.linalg.solve(XtX, Xty)
   ```

5. **Extract Results**:
   ```python
   self.intercept = theta[0]
   self.coefficients = theta[1:]
   ```

#### R-Squared Calculation:
```python
def manual_r2(self, y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculate R-squared manually"""
    y_mean = np.mean(y_true)
    ss_total = np.sum((y_true - y_mean) ** 2)
    ss_residual = np.sum((y_true - y_pred) ** 2)
    return 1 - (ss_residual / ss_total)
```

**R-Squared Formula**:
```
R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
```

Where:
- `SS_res = Σ(yi - ŷi)²` (Sum of Squares of Residuals)
- `SS_tot = Σ(yi - ȳ)²` (Total Sum of Squares)
- `ŷi` = predicted values
- `ȳ` = mean of observed values

#### Mean Squared Error:
```python
def manual_mse(self, y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculate Mean Squared Error manually"""
    return np.mean((y_true - y_pred) ** 2)
```

**MSE Formula**:
```
MSE = (1/n) × Σ(yi - ŷi)²
```

## Feature Engineering

### Historical Pattern Analysis

```python
def analyze_historical_patterns(teams_df):
    """Analyze historical patterns of Super Bowl winners"""
```

**Metrics Analyzed**:

1. **Win Percentage Patterns**:
   ```python
   sb_win_pct = superbowl_teams['winPct'].mean()
   other_win_pct = non_superbowl_teams['winPct'].mean()
   ```

2. **Point Differential Analysis**:
   ```python
   sb_point_diff = superbowl_teams['netPoints'].mean()
   other_point_diff = non_superbowl_teams['netPoints'].mean()
   ```

3. **Home vs Road Performance**:
   ```python
   home_win_pct = homeWins / (homeWins + homeLosses)
   road_win_pct = roadWins / (roadWins + roadLosses)
   ```

### Advanced Feature Creation

```python
def create_advanced_features(teams_df):
    """Create advanced features based on historical patterns"""
```

**New Features Created**:

1. **Scoring Efficiency**:
   ```python
   scoring_efficiency = pointsFor / (pointsFor + pointsAgainst)
   ```
   - Range: 0 to 1
   - Higher values indicate better offensive performance relative to defensive performance

2. **Home-Road Consistency**:
   ```python
   home_road_consistency = 1 - abs(home_win_pct - road_win_pct)
   ```
   - Range: 0 to 1
   - Higher values indicate more consistent performance regardless of venue

3. **Wins Above Average**:
   ```python
   wins_above_average = team_wins - league_average_wins
   ```
   - Can be positive or negative
   - Indicates how much better/worse than average

4. **Championship Profile Score**:
   ```python
   championship_profile = (winPct × 0.4) + (scoring_efficiency × 0.3) + 
                         (home_road_consistency × 0.15) + (strength_of_schedule × 0.15)
   ```
   - Composite metric combining multiple performance indicators
   - Weighted average of key success factors

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Train-Test Split Implementation

```python
def manual_train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42):
    """Manual implementation of train-test split"""
```

**Process**:
1. **Set Random Seed**: Ensures reproducible results
2. **Calculate Split Sizes**: 
   ```python
   n_test = int(n_samples * test_size)
   ```
3. **Random Permutation**: Shuffles indices randomly
4. **Split Data**: Separates training and testing sets

### Data Preparation Function

```python
def prepare_modeling_data(df):
    """Prepare clean data for modeling"""
```

**Feature Selection Strategy**:
- **Base Features**: Essential NFL metrics (wins, winPct, netPoints, etc.)
- **Optional Features**: Advanced metrics if available
- **Target Variable**: `is_superbowl_winner` (binary: 1 = winner, 0 = non-winner)

## Prediction System

### 2025 Super Bowl Prediction

The notebook implements a multi-method prediction system:

#### Method 1: Linear Regression Model
Uses trained coefficients to predict Super Bowl probability:
```python
predictions_2025 = model.predict(X_2025)
```

#### Method 2: Championship Profile Analysis
Ranks teams based on composite performance metrics:
```python
teams_sorted_profile = teams_2025_df.sort_values('championship_profile', ascending=False)
```

#### Method 3: Composite Prediction System
Combines multiple prediction methods with weights:
```python
final_prediction = (lr_norm × 0.4) + (profile_norm × 0.4) + ((winPct - 0.5) × 0.2)
```

**Weighting Strategy**:
- Linear Regression: 40% weight
- Championship Profile: 40% weight  
- Current Performance: 20% weight

### Normalization Formula
```python
normalized_score = (score - min_score) / (max_score - min_score)
```
This ensures all prediction methods contribute equally on a 0-1 scale.
